Pretendo is an open-source project that aims to recreate Nintendo Network for the 3DS and Wii U using clean-room reverse engineering.

Because their services will be both free and open source, they can exist long after the inevitable closure of Nintendo Network.


I built the website based on [mrjvs](https://mrjvs.com)'s design for the project. It is available on https://pretendo.network
