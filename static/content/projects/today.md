Today is a client I built for Makerlog, a community you can use to easily keep track of your todos, and view what you've done recently. You can check Makerlog out [here](https://getmakerlog.com).

The project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jipfr/today). The project is no longer functional due to changes in the API.
