I built PvP Legacy's website! It features their logo, a description of their Minecraft server, the "online player"-count with the IP to join, a link to the shop, and a Discord embed.

I found a few designs online to serve as inspiration. They told me which they liked, and we iterated the website's design based on that.

The website is available on https://pvplegacy.net/
